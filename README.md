The goal of this script is to:
1) Separate the QRST wave from the atrial activity from an ECG signal using ensemble averaging;
2) Estimate the oscillatory rate (in Hz; that is the main frequency at which the atria are stimulated as a result of the disorganized activities of the myocytes during AF) from the atrial activity only using power spectral density estimation. The sampling rate of the provided signal is 1000 Hz.
